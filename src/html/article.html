                            Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection could direct the timely initiation of antifungal therapy. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies where CrAg detection in serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and CSF fungal culture were done on adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had suspected cryptococcal meningitis (CM).

                            With Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2), we evaluated the risk of bias in 11 included studies with 3600 participants, and used a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain summary sensitivity and specificity of serum and CSF CrAg, as well as agreement between CSF CrAg and CSF culture.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Summary sensitivity and specificity of serum CrAg were 99.7% (97.4-100) and 94.1% (88.3-98.1), respectively, and summary sensitivity and specificity of CSF CrAg were 98.8% (96.2-99.6) and 99.3% (96.7-99.9), respectively. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Agreement between CSF CrAg and CSF culture was 98% (97-99). In adults living with HIV who have CM symptoms, serum CrAg negativity may rule out CM, while positivity should prompt induction antifungal therapy if lumbar puncture is not feasible. In a first episode of CM, CSF CrAg positivity is diagnostic.
