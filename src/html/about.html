                        CASCADE is a repository of clinical trials that have been used to improve the HIV care cascade (initiation of treatment, adherence to antiretroviral therapy and retention in care).
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The studies have been curated by income level, vulnerable population, who delivered the intervention, the setting in which it was delivered, the intervention type and the level of pragmatism of the intervention (i.e., how close it is to real-world care). You can use it to learn about interventions, create evidence maps, conduct methodological research, and conduct literature and systematic reviews).

                        We used a comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy of systematic reviews, supplemented with a search for trials. Given the need to characterise studies in detail, only studies with a full text publication are included here. All data are processed in duplicate. If you are aware of any trial that should be here <a href="#">contact us</a>.
